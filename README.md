---

Welcome to the 21.co DataViz Python Engineer technical test. This is an opportunity to **showcase your skills** in developing data visualizations and dashboards using **Streamlit**.

## üèÉ How to Proceed

1. **Branch Creation**: Start by creating a new branch from the `dev` branch - or fork the project.
2. **Commit Regularly**: Regularly commit your changes to record the progress of your solution.
3. **Documentation**: Thoroughly document your approach and findings throughout the development process.
4. **Pull Request**: Once you've completed the task, create a pull request, assign it to yourself, and tag the person who invited you for a review.

## üèÜ Challenge

- The test is separated into 2 exercises. One is to implement a dashboard from scratch based on a Figma design, and the other is to optimize an already existing dashboard with performance-related issues.
- **Duration**: You have 1 week from the date of receiving this email to complete the interview.
- **Programming Language**: Python is the designated programming language for this test, focusing on dashboard design, development, and data visualization. We specifically recommend using Streamlit version 1.34.0 or higher (as of 10th May 2024) to showcase your skills.

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Pertinence of Answers**: Your solutions should be relevant to the problem statement. Address the main issue rather than focusing on minor details unless specified.
- **Clean Code**: Your code should be readable and maintainable. Think about someone else reading your code. Would they understand your approach?
- **Documentation & Reasoning**: Instead of attempting to answer everything and compromising on quality, focus on delivering fewer but well-documented solutions. Your documentation should detail:
  - Your thought process.
  - Any assumptions you've made.
  - Challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
  - Any trade-offs you made in your solutions.
  - Further improvements or extensions you would make with more time.
- **Rigorous Reasoning**: Ensure that your solutions are backed by rigorous reasoning, especially if they involve complex problems or scenarios.
- **Dashboard Performance**: Think about cache, speed, and overall performance of your dashboard. Optimize your code to ensure it runs efficiently, handles data effectively, and ensures low loading times for the end user.
- **Creativity with Data Visualization**: Consider the best ways to visualize your data and results for the problem at hand. Experiment with different charts and interactive elements to enhance the interpretability of your analysis.
- **Simplicity and Clear Explanations**: Your solutions should strive for simplicity. Avoid overly complex solutions when a simpler one will suffice. Moreover, be prepared to provide clear and concise explanations for your choices, methodologies, and results.

## Recommendations for Success

- **Test Your Code**: Before submission, test your code with various cases to ensure its correctness. If applicable, include these tests.
- **Stay Organized**: Structure your codebase. If you're working on multiple problems or modules, have a clear directory and file structure.
- **Reach Out**: If anything is unclear or you face any issues, don't hesitate to contact us. It's better to ask and clarify than to make assumptions.

## Submission

You can send back a file archive as a mail attachment or a private GitHub link. Ensure that you include all necessary files, documentation, and resources required to understand and run your code. Your results and submissions will be discussed in depth in the next round.

**Note**: The questions of each exercise are explained in the associated README file for each exercise.
